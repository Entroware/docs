## Introduction to User and Group Management

User and group management is a fundamental aspect of Linux system administration, enabling administrators to control access to resources and maintain system security. This guide explores various techniques for managing users and groups effectively.

### User Management

#### 1. Creating Users

To create a new user, use the `useradd` command followed by the desired username, in this case we create the user `john`:

```bash
user@machine:~$ sudo useradd john
```

#### 2. Modifying User Properties

To modify the properties of the user `john` such as the user's full name or shell, the `usermod` command is used:

```bash
user@machine:~$ sudo usermod -c "John Smith" -s /bin/bash john
```

#### 3. Deleting Users

To delete a user account, use the `userdel` command:

```bash
user@machine:~$ sudo userdel john
```

### Group Management

#### 1. Creating Groups

To create a new group, use the `groupadd` command followed by the group name:

```bash
user@machine:~$ sudo groupadd groupname
```

#### 2. Modifying Group Properties

To modify group properties, such as the group's name `groupmod` is used:

```bash
user@machine:~$ sudo groupmod -n newgroupname groupname
```

#### 3. Deleting Groups

To delete a group, use the `groupdel` command:

```bash
user@machine:~$ sudo groupdel groupname
```


#### 4. Assigning Users to Groups

To assign a user to a group, use the `usermod` command with the `-aG` option:

```bash
user@machine:~$ sudo usermod -aG groupname username
```

#### 5. Viewing User Groups

With the `groups` command you can view the groups a user belongs to:

```bash
user@machine:~$ groups username
```


### Conclusion

Effective user and group management is crucial for maintaining system security and resource access control in Linux environments. By leveraging the commands and techniques outlined in this guide, system administrators can efficiently create, modify, and delete user accounts and groups, ensuring permissions are effectively managed to safeguard sensitive data and system resources.
