## Introduction to Linux File Permissions

Linux file permissions regulate access to files and directories, ensuring security and control over who can read, write, or execute them. Understanding both symbolic and numeric representation of permissions is essential for managing files effectively.

### Symbolic Representation

In symbolic representation, permissions are represented by three characters: `r` (read), `w` (write), and `x` (execute).

- `rwx` indicates read, write, and execute permissions.
- `rw-` indicates read and write permissions, but no execute permission.
- `r--` indicates read-only permission.

It's important to note that a directory requires the execute `x` permission to be able to access it.

### Numeric Representation

Numeric representation simplifies permissions by assigning a numeric value to each permission:

| Permission | Numeric Value |
|------------|---------------|
| Read (r)   | 4             |
| Write (w)  | 2             |
| Execute (x)| 1             |

To calculate the numeric representation for a set of permissions, add up the values for each permission type. For example:

- **Read and write**: `4 (read)` + `2 (write)` = `6`
- **Read, write, and execute**: `4 (read)` + `2 (write)` + `1 (execute)` = `7`


### User, Group, and Others Permissions

Each file or directory has three sets of permission numbers corresponding to user, group, and others.

For example setting the following would equate to a `775` or `rwxr-xr-x` for the files full permissions.

- **User Permissions**: `7` represents read, write, and execute (`rwx`).
- **Group Permissions**: `5` represents read and execute (`r-x`).
- **Other Permissions**: `5` represents read and execute (`r-x`).

### Command Examples

Let's see some examples:

This command sets `myfile.txt` to `7 (user) 5 (group) 5 (others)` or `rwxr-xr-x`:
```bash
user@machine:~$ chmod 755 myfile.txt
```

This command sets `myfile.txt` to `6 (user) 4 (group) 4 (others)` or `rw-r--r--`:
```bash
user@machine:~$ chmod 644 myfile.txt
```

### Conclusion

Understanding both symbolic and numeric representations of Linux file permissions is crucial for effective file management. By mastering these concepts, users can accurately set permissions to control access to files and directories, ensuring security and privacy on Linux systems.
