## Introduction
This article aims to clarify confusion surrounding USB naming conventions and operating modes across different generations.


## Reasons for confusion

﻿The confusion between USB port designation and their speeds primarily stems from two main factors:

1) Naming Conventions: The naming conventions for USB ports do not always clearly indicate their speed capabilities, leading to potential misunderstandings. For example, at a glance you may think that *USB 3.2 Gen 1x1* is faster than *USB 3.1* or *USB 3.1 Gen 2* however it is actually half the speed.


2) Marketing Terminology: Marketing often uses vague terms like "SuperSpeed" and "SuperSpeedPlus", which can be unclear about the actual speed.


## Designations

Here we have tables that show the previously used naming designations and the new naming designations.
